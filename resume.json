Likewise, he's diligent at sharing best practices for dealing with existing code due to his meticulous nature and willingness to understand how things work under the hood.\n\nAs an engineer, Ben's not limited to one particular part of the stack; he's someone who can change focus quickly when necessary in order to get things done. His dedication and workflow are things that inspire the best out of other engineers."
